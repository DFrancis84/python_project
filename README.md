# Code Louisville Back-end Python Project Material
___

##The contents of this Repo are to be used to complete the Final Project for the Back-end Python Course within Code Louisville.
___
### Prep Work
First things first, you will need to Download and Install the Anaconda package as it contains all the dependencies/tools needed to complete the project. Be sure to download the correct version for which OS you are using.
    `https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/`
___

To complete this project, you will need to do the following:
    1.  Download the material to your local computer
    2.  Review the `challenges.txt` file.  This contains what is required to be considered for completion of the course
    3.  Use Jupyter-Notebook to enter your code display your results
    4.  Use either Postgres OR SQLite to complete this (in my experience, sqlite is the easier of the two)
    5.  Create and connect to your database in your code
    6.  Using pandas, import your `.csv` file into your `.db`
    7.  Create multiple queries to get the data that you need to complete the challenges
        *hint* _Setting each query to a variable is a good idea to help make displaying easy_
    8.  Provide a brief description above each query of what you are trying to retrieve
    9. Test your project on someone else's computer
    10. Commit your project to your Github account

While I do have it listed that you only need to commit your project to your Github once, I would recommend commiting to it *EVERYTIME* you make a change. This will help to prevent data loss in event of something happening to your computer.
